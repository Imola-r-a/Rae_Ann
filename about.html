				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Kia Ora, I’m Imola Tantrum and I’m currently based in London, and am studying a BA in Graphic and Digital design, with my designed focus being Illustrations and print designs such as books and prints. I like to work with both analogue and digital techniques to archive my outcomes, my blended style of techniques establishes a unique look that is often inspired by my Māori heritage. I love to show people the wonders of who I am using the intricate patterns, colours and stories of New Zealand. This can bring to life a new part of the world that may be foreign to you.  </p>
