            <h3>Poetic Documentary</h3>
            <p> This was a group projects where we were given the brief to create a copy version of a video. Me and Clara decided to create a copy of the video ‘living empty’ by Jahvis Loveday. We adapted the copy into something new, something about the British sea and the nostalgia of playing by the beach. Me and Clara both grew up by the sea so creating this poetic documentary was a great chance to dive into our own memories.</p>
