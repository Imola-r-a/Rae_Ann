            <h2>The New Art of Making Books</h2>
            <h3> Print Publication</h3>
            <p> With this publication I created a book with the text from ‘The New Art of Making Books’ by Ulises Carrion. I really tried to use this experience to experiment like layout, grids, illustration and mark making. I used a range of different methods to create both the cover and page designs such as lino printing, marbling, monoprinting and illustrations.
                I really tried to take each section of the book and push the text to become more, I wanted to incorporate the words and meaning into the design itself, so it becomes intertwined. I made this book with the intension of it being more than words, I wanted the designs added and incorporated to become just as meaningful.
