            <h2>Mural in Stockwell</h2>
            <h3>Collage Mural</h3>
            <p> For the 10-year anniversary a small group of students and tutors created a new mural for our Universities Stockwell St. campus library in Greenwich. 
                We used a collection of images from past students that we got from the University’s achieve as well as photos of current students and mixed them with images from the university’s architecture, gardens and the river Thames. The focal designed element of our design was cyanotype as we used this method on photographs and plants which lead to the use of the iconic blue that comes with this technique. This piece is a collage of the heart of Greenwich.
                As a group we researched into the brief given by the Marketing team as well as what students would like to see. It was a great opportunity to work with our university to create this piece.
