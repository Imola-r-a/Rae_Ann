            <h2>20 years of the Afghanistan War</h2>
            <h3> Inforgraphic</h3>
            <p> This is a series of three infographics that display a range of information I learn while researching the 20-year Afghanistan war. I chose this topic because my farther served two tours in Afghanistan (He is the soldier featured in the Deployment poster), and I wanted to know more about what happened as it was such a prevalent event in mine and his life.
                I used Adobe Illustrator to create these illustrations with some edited marbling designs. Trying to find the balance of illustration to information was a challenge in the project as Iâ€™s never created a poster with so much information on it. I tried to break it up into more manageable sections to make the information more digestible to the reader.
